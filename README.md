# IBM-HR-Attrition-Dashboard-Project
This Power BI dashboard analyzes employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. It provides insights into attrition trends by job role, department, demographics, distance from home, satisfaction levels, and more — helping organizations understand key drivers behind employee turnover.

2. Demographics
Gender Distribution (Male: 60%, Female: 40%)

Attrition by:

Key Stats:

Avg. Age of Attrition: 33.61

Highest attrition in age group 31–40
